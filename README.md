Probing of Language Model Representations for Biases
==============================

Project for [Computational Semantics for Natural Language Processing](https://www.mrinmaya.io/teaching_csnlp24) at ETH ZÃ¼rich, Spring Semester 2024.

See our [proposal](docs/proposal.pdf), [progress report](docs/Progress_Report.pdf), [poster](docs/poster.pdf) and [final report](docs/Final_Report.pdf).

For the installation procedure, follow [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

Because of lack of resources we opted to have the evaluation script on a google drive folder which can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_16Jw_MPmz3fw_TCK7f0mDv9CywEYOEG?usp=drive_link). To run the evaluation script please clone your repository to your drive, place the generated encodings in the respective folder and check the first cell where the current drive is mounted.
